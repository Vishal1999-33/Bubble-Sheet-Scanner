# About

The main objective of this project was to build a computer vision system using Python and OpenCV that can read and grade bubble sheet tests.

Below I have included a screenshot of sheet after applying edge detection:-

Below I have included an example image that demonstrates the *__docCnt__*  variable being drawn on the original image:

After applying Otsuâ€™s thresholding method, our exam is now a binary image:

Below I have included an example of creating and applying a mask to each bubble associated with a question:
